Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luying, a second year master student in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania. 

I'm currently a Teaching Assistant for class CIS5810 Computer Vision and Computational Photography by [Prof. Jianbo Shi](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/).

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mangharam](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/) of X-Lab from [School of Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) and [Prof. Matni](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/nikolai-matni/) from [UPenn GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/), University of Pennsylvania.

My research interest:
- &nbsp; Computer Vision
- &nbsp; Machine Perception
- &nbsp; Machine Learning
- &nbsp; Autonomous Systems
